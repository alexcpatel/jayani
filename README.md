## Jayani Music Website

This is the website for singer/songwriter Max Patel, also known as Jayani. It is a create-react-app running on a node.js backend. The project uses anime.js for animations, luxon for time formatting, google apis for mapping and timezone locality, and mailchimp's api for handling mailing lists. All components, server code, and css are written from scratch.
